# Neighbourfy

This is an expansion of our Cardiff University year 2 group project

The aim of the project/site is to allow communities to lend tools to each other for a short period. This is to reduce the need for buying a tool, use it once or twice and get left in the shed, only to become waste. 

## Users of the site can:
- search for a tool using:
  - a search bar
  - different sorting methods ( coming soon )
  - filtering ( coming soon )
- place a deposit on the desired tool they wish to borrow
- borrower and lender can communicate via a messaging portal for details on 
  - time and place to collect the tool
  - duration of lending
  - any other must knows about using the tool
- after the lender has finished they can return the tool
  - with a photo and the condition of the tool upon return
- a borrower can review a lender and will be displayed on the lender's public profile
